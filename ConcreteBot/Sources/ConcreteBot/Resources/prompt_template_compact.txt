MIX RULES
- Use ONLY MIX ROW LINES for Mix Customer/Additional Mix fields.
- If MIX PARSED HINTS has Row 1/2/3, map Row 1 -> Mix Customer, Row 2 -> Mix Additional 1, Row 3 -> Mix Additional 2.
- If only one mix row is present, Mix Additional 1/2 must be null.
- Do not copy Mix Customer values into Additional rows.
- If a column is blank, return null for that field.
- Use Spec for both "Cust. Descr." and "Description".
- Slump must only come from the mix row; do not use Extra Charges.

EXTRA CHARGES RULES
- Use ONLY EXTRA CHARGES TEXT.
- Each charge is its own object with Description and Qty.
- Do not add, remove, reorder, or combine charges.
